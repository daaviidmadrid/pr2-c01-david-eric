# Beta Testing

## Testing scenarios

- Case A: The game is fully functional - i.e., frontend and backend are implemented and communicate correctly. In this case, the testing is performed on the frontend by playing the game.
- Case B: The game is partially functional - i.e., frontend is not fully connected to the backend. In this case, the testing is performed on the backend by sending requests to the API endpoints using the `api/v1/*/` endpoints or `docs/` url.
- Case C: The backend is partially functional - i.e., the backend is not fully implemented. In this case, the testers will interview the developers about what is working and what is not, and about the main issues they encountered and discuss/advise on how to fix them.
